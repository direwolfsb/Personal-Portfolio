# Suyog's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences as a Junior Computer Science student at the University of South Florida. I designed and built this site from scratch using HTML and CSS, and I plan to continuously update it as I learn new skills and work on more projects.
